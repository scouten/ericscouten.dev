> Many people underestimate the importance of deleting unnecessary code, it still has to be read and understood.

– [Martin Fowler](https://twitter.com/martinfowler/status/788827419641643009), Twitter, 2016

> +1 Many times when I've deleted dead code, SCM history showed it was edited a few times after it was unused.

> Bad software doesn't start with bad developers. It starts with good, decent people who make decisions that seem right on the day but in aggregate, considered over a longer lifetime, are indefensible.
