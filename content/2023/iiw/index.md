This week I'm attending the 37th biannual **[Internet Identity Workshop](https://internetidentityworkshop.com)**, in which a few dozen of the world's leading experts on digital identity and credentials gather and a couple hundred more of us do our best to keep up and learn from them.

This work is closely related to my work for [Adobe](https://adobe.com) in which I help define and implement the **[Content Authencity Initiative](https://contentauthenticity.org).** CAI defines itself as:

> ... a community of media and tech companies, NGOs, academics, and others working to promote adoption of an open industry standard for content authenticity and provenance. 

We are particularly interested enabling content creators to identify themselves as the creators of their content and credibly refute false claims of authorship on their behalf, which is why I am attending this conference for the third time. This is my first time attempting to describe it in real time as the conference proceeds.

## The Venue

IIW is held at the lovely **[Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org/)**, which recounts the formative years of our tech industry. CHM is located in Mountain View, California, right in the heart of Silicon Valley.

I'll share a few photos of the venue and the conference. My non-technical friends might want to bow out after this section as it will rapidly descend into lots of deep geek speak.

_(to do: add photos of CHM)_

## The Format

IIW is conducted as an **"[unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference),"** which means that there is a pre-defined _structure_ to the conference, but not a predefined _agenda._

There are several variations on how the agenda gets built at an unconference. In IIW's case, there is an opening meeting on each morning in which people stand up and describe sessions they'd like to lead that day. Then there's a mad rush to schedule these sessions (see photo below) and we all choose, in the moment, which sessions to attend.

You might think that not having a predefined agenda would mean that the topics that occur could be flimsy or weak or low in value. In practice, the opposite is true. Both times I've attended this conference so far, I've had to make very difficult choices about which sessions _not_ to attend so I could attend something else which was _also_ very compelling.

Last time (in April), I managed to schedule a weekend to myself [disappearing on the Mendocino coast](https://ericscouten.travel/2023/04-18+california/35-36-on-california-coast/) to decompress afterward. For those of us who are introverts, I highly recommend scheduling some kind of downtime like this afterward. (I talked to almost nobody for four days after IIW and it was _perfect._) This time, I'm headed home for some important family time, so no decompression buffer.

And, with that, here is my description of the sessions I'm attending this time around:
