This week I'm in Berlin, attending the **[European Identity Conference](https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024).** When I attended the IIW earlier this spring, [I wrote about it in real time](/2024/iiw38) as the conference was in progress. That format worked well for me and received a lot of compliments, so I'm attempting it again this week.

# Why Am I Here?

I'm part of a team at [Adobe](https://adobe.com) that is dedicated to helping content creators and content consumers establish genuine connections with each other. We do this through three organizations that we've helped to create:

* **[Content Authenticity Initiative](https://contentauthenticity.org):** CAI is a community of media and tech companies, NGOs, academics, and others working to promote adoption of an open industry standard for content authenticity and provenance. The CAI does outreach, advocacy, and education around these open standards. Content Authenticity Initiative is also the name of the business unit of which I'm a part at Adobe through which we participate in all three of these organizations, develop open source and open standards, and guide implementation within Adobe's product and service suite.

* **[Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity](https://c2pa.org):** C2PA is a technical standards organization which addresses the prevalence of misleading information online through the development of technical standards for certifying the source and history (or provenance) of media content.

* **[Creator Assertions Working Group](https://creator-assertions.github.io):** CAWG builds upon the work of the C2PA by defining additional assertions that allow content creators to express individual and organizational identity and intent about their content.

I recently published an article titled **[Content Authenticity 101](/2024/content-authenticity-101.md),** which explains these organizations and our motivations in more detail.

# Tuesday Sessions

## [Defense against Mis/Disinformation Roundtable: Collaboration through Standards](https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5705/1)
