This week I'm in Berlin, attending the **[European Identity Conference](https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024).** When I attended the IIW earlier this spring, [I wrote about it in real time](/2024/iiw38) as the conference was in progress. That format worked well for me and received a lot of compliments, so I'm attempting it again this week.

# Why Am I Here?

I'm part of a team at [Adobe](https://adobe.com) that is dedicated to helping content creators and content consumers establish genuine connections with each other. We do this through three organizations that we've helped to create:

* **[Content Authenticity Initiative](https://contentauthenticity.org):** CAI is a community of media and tech companies, NGOs, academics, and others working to promote adoption of an open industry standard for content authenticity and provenance. The CAI does outreach, advocacy, and education around these open standards. Content Authenticity Initiative is also the name of the business unit of which I'm a part at Adobe through which we participate in all three of these organizations, develop open source and open standards, and guide implementation within Adobe's product and service suite.

* **[Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity](https://c2pa.org):** C2PA is a technical standards organization which addresses the prevalence of misleading information online through the development of technical standards for certifying the source and history (or provenance) of media content.

* **[Creator Assertions Working Group](https://creator-assertions.github.io):** CAWG builds upon the work of the C2PA by defining additional assertions that allow content creators to express individual and organizational identity and intent about their content.

I recently published an article titled **[Content Authenticity 101](/2024/content-authenticity-101.md),** which explains these organizations and our motivations in more detail.

# Tuesday Sessions

_NOTE: Rather than trying to take comprehensive notes for each presentation, I'll add slides as they become available and photos when I have a moment to catch up. What I'm sharing for now are generally comments that aren't immediately obvious from the slides._

## [DID - Catching the Wave in Government and Financial Services](https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5481)

Interesting things not directly on slides:

* Bangladesh GDP increased 7% after national digital ID program launched.
* eIDAS 2 _requires_ relying parties above a certain size to accept EU digital credentials.
* Introduced to the concept of "rogue verifiers."
* Interesting that X.509 is the backing architecture for issuer trust registries in the EU trust infrastructure.

## [Defense against Mis/Disinformation Roundtable: Collaboration through Standards](https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5705/1)

_VERY_ full room. 

This session spoke to security and user control of credentials, but did not cover misinformation/disinformation as we think of it in the CAI/C2PA sense. (We think primarily about misrepresenting context, technique, or identity as a way to mislead.)

Content not directly on slides:

* Sam Curren gave a demo of OpenIDIDComm.
  * Value proposition: You can add distributed identity to an existing identity infrastructure.
* [DID method rubric](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-rubric/) -- check link ... is this what Kim was referring to?

## [Vision 2030: Rethinking Digital Identity in the Era of AI and Decentralization](https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5486)
_Martin Kuppinger_

(Title tl;dr: Finally solving the IAM puzzle.)

"Will decentrialized ID really be the thing that helps us solve the puzzle?" (Which puzzle.)

Interesting axes: Security/protection vs enablement, technology vs business

I like the term "identity silos." (They won't go away quietly.)

"The risk of siloed wallets."

## [Protocols, Payloads, Policies, Oh My!: How can Enterprise Customers Make Better Decisions?](https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5487)
_Anil John, US Department of Homeland Security_

"Just like the Trojans, you are going to be getting a lot of gifts."

"The right to paper" as a way of saying digital is not a requirement.

Everybody who is arguing for their standards: "A swirling whirlpool of doom." (Obligatory reference to the XKCD "competing standards" comic.)

Mistake: Don't assume that issuers and verifiers will move in tandem.

## [IAM at the Front of the Cyber War: Are We Able to Beat the Bad Guys?](https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5488)
_Ivo van Bennekom, EMEA Impact Center Leader Digital Identity_

Sweden saw rise in cyberattacks by 239% in the months prior to joining NATO.

## [Misinformation, Disinformation, Malinformation: How to Build Public Trust in a Crisis-Shaken World](https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5495)
_Joni Brennan, Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada_

Canada building a digital identity platform starting late 2021. Wow ... conspiracy theories killed this off.

I love her use of "super-spreaders" to describe misinformation ... super-spreader.

"Authenticity is the new identity."
