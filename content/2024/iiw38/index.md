This week I'm attending the 38th biannual **[Internet Identity Workshop](https://internetidentityworkshop.com),** which is one of the most valuable conferences I've encountered in any professional space. As the name might suggest, the topics are largely around how to express human and organizational identity in digital terms that respect privacy and security.

In my work at [Adobe](https://adobe.com) I help define and implement the **[Content Authencity Initiative](https://contentauthenticity.org).** I recently published an article titled **[Content Authenticity 101](/2024/content-authenticity-101.md),** which explains the various organizations that I'm most involved with in this space.

We are particularly interested in enabling content creators to identify themselves as the creators of their content and credibly refute false claims of authorship on their behalf, which is why I am attending this conference for the third time. This is my first time attempting to describe it in real time as the conference proceeds.

## The Venue

IIW is held at the lovely **[Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org/)**, which recounts the formative years of our tech industry. CHM is located in Mountain View, California, right in the heart of Silicon Valley.

I'll share a few photos of the venue and the conference. My non-technical friends might want to bow out after this section as it will rapidly descend into lots of deep geek speak.

## The Format

IIW is conducted as an **"[unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference),"** which means that there is a pre-defined _structure_ to the conference, but not a predefined _agenda._

There are several variations on how the agenda gets built at an unconference. In IIW's case, there is an opening meeting on each morning in which people stand up and describe sessions they'd like to lead that day. Then there's a mad rush to schedule these sessions (see photo below) and we all choose, in the moment, which sessions to attend.

You might think that not having a predefined agenda would mean that the topics that occur could be flimsy or weak or low in value. In practice, the opposite is true. Both times I've attended this conference so far, I've had to make very difficult choices about which sessions _not_ to attend so I could attend something else which was _also_ very compelling.

Last time (in April), I managed to schedule a weekend to myself [disappearing on the Mendocino coast](https://ericscouten.travel/2023/04-18+california/35-36-on-california-coast/) to decompress afterward and I'll be doing similarly this time. For those of us who are introverts, I highly recommend scheduling some kind of downtime like this afterward. (I talked to almost nobody for four days after IIW and it was _perfect._)

And, with that, here is my description of the sessions I'm attending this time around:
