**Hi, I'm Eric.**

This my home for technical / programming related content.

As of this writing (May 2021), I'm just getting started with this blog. I plan to move some previous content from other sites and will be writing new articles soon.

I am also [a photographer](https://ericscouten.com) and [an outdoor explorer](https://146parks.blog).

I hope you enjoy following this or another of my blogs!
