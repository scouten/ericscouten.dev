Yesterday, my team helped sponsor the third [Content Authenticity Summit](https://www.contentauthenticitysummit.com) at Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island in New York City.

<!-- more -->

We brought together over 200 people who are committed to the cause of content provenance as an important part of the solution to the problems of misinformation and misattribution of content on the internet.

I will leave it to others (including, in time, our team's official communications) to summarize the event, but I will say I feel very happy with how the event came together. As always, I work with a team of sharp and talented professionals.

I gave two talks at the summit regarding the tools we have built and will build to provide content creators the opportunity to provide their own attribution and context for the content they've created.
