I am beyond honored to have been named as one of the 25 “movers and shakers” of the digital identity space for 2025. Thank you, Austin Arensberg, Eunice Wong, and the team at Okta Ventures for naming me to this list and preparing the video profile where I could talk about my work and that of the [Content Authenticity Initiative](https://contentauthenticity.org) team.

This whole process has been a true honor from start to finish.

My career has taken me lots of places, but the marquee at Nasdaq was not one I was expecting. Nevertheless, here I am.

I especially liked the video profile that they prepared about my work and that of my team.
